Alien Life Forms:
Aquafins: Graceful, dolphin-like creatures that inhabit the oceans. They are highly intelligent and have been known to guide ships through dangerous waters. Aquafins communicate using complex songs that can be heard for miles underwater, and they seem to enjoy interacting with human divers, often playing games with them.

Treetenders: These beings are humanoid in appearance but have bark-like skin and leafy hair. They live in the jungles and are deeply connected to the planet's flora. Treetenders are peaceful and serve as the guardians of the jungle, ensuring the balance of the ecosystem. They are skilled in herbal medicine and are eager to share their knowledge with humans.
Sandstriders: These large, camel-like creatures have long legs adapted to traverse the scorching deserts. Their humps store water, and they are incredibly resilient, able to go for months without drinking.
